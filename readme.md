# running

Check out this repo, run `npm install` to get all of the depencencies, then
`npm run build` to build all of the typescript code. Then you can either
open the index.html file in your browser directly, or do `npm run local-dev`
to start a simple http server. Either way get it running in your browser
and you can play.

This game is hosted live at [https://apps.josh.earth/scrooge_game/](https://apps.josh.earth/scrooge_game/)
